        <h3>Notes / Explanation</h3>
        <p>
          I started with the animation of Satan and Mr. Cabal. Now you may have guessed that these are not models of the 
          characters from the book I happen to be reading at the moment, because those don't exist. I instead chose to use models of characters they reminded me of, 
          replacing Mr Cabal with a character known as Spamton and Satan one referred to as Tenna (like antenna, because he has a CRT for a head). 
          From this point forward I'll be referring to them by those names for simplicity's sake.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have three primary reasons behind my choice for the character models. 
          The first of course has its roots in personal interest. I had already seen and was already curious about the models 
          from familiarity with the characters, and thought their demeanor was fitting. The game they come from is about 
          objects coming to life, so I already knew how I could frame what I wanted to do in a way that hopefully wouldn't lose the audience. 
          The second is my desire for practice with 
          complex and simple rigs. I've used the rig generator used on Tenna before, so I knew the basics 
          of the controls, but when I tried making models the topology and weight painting were somewhat limiting and I wanted practice with 
          properly made models, hoping I could study the topology afterwards and understand what made it work. I also wanted to practice 
          animating simpler rigs, with none of the generated bells and whistles, so I chose the Spamton model for that purpose. The third reason is that these characters
          don't need traditional lip flaps, and thats going to be a requirement if I'm working with dialogue and I want to submit this on time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did have to make a few modifications to the rigs though. For Tenna, I had to redo most of the shading, as it was much too 
          stylized, though I kept it for the face, as the brightness seemed fitting for a glowing screen. Spamton also needed a minor shader adjustment 
          to add transparency to his glasses for one shot, but the primary issue was in the rigging.
          The initial issue being that the eye controls weren't hooked up properly so I had to learn what a "Damped Track" was, 
          but I also found that there was no bone to control the position of the glasses; It seems they were meant to stay in place. An odd but simple fix.
          While not necessarily a rigging issue, Tenna doesn't have any controls to change
          the shape of his head, so I used a lattice modifier in his last shot, as I felt it wasn't expressive enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may notice that I cut the shot where Tenna points his thumb at himself. My plans had to change when I realized
          that the rigs arm poles weren't working properly so I couldn't position the elbows. I had already animated up to that point so I had to cut to the next
          shot to avoid having to redo the animation or figure out retargeting. I ended up just importing a new version of the rig that I could use for the next scene, 
          this time giving a thorough test for
          every function I planned on using.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          While animating to an audio recording ensured I would hit the required length, after test screenings with my family
          I figured a short prelude to ease the viewer in would be best, so I cut the last board and started working on
          the opening shot where the narrator uses her dress to drift down and softly land on the couch, and began narrating the book I 
          was reading from. 

          I certainly appreciated finishing with one of my own models, while I felt the limitations of the poor weight painting I think I was able
          to navigate it well.
